# Henrik's blog

This is an attempt to collect snippets, tricks, notes and visualizations made predominantly in R. I've had a few of these going before; my most notable set of charts are collected in [a Github repo](https://github.com/halhen/viz-pub) and announced via my (nowadays mostly silent) [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/hnrklndbrg).

You might be interested in my [book notes](tags/book-notes/) or my [R stuff](tags/r/).
