# Henrik's blog

Another place I hope to every so often write up whatever cool things I've learned. I've had a few of these going before; my most notable set of charts are collected in [a now retired Github repo](https://github.com/halhen/viz-pub).

So far, I have some [book notes](tags/book-notes/) and some [R stuff](tags/r/). Source code, in particular to recreate the R things, are at [my Github page](https://github.com/halhen/blog/).
